Hello, my name is Tony and this is my first ever blog. I'm a Cybersecurity student and passionate about technology. I created this blog to share my methods and projects while I continue to learn and grow in the field of Cybersecurity. I hope you find my content useful and informative. 

I have a few projects in the works and I'm excited to share them with you. I'm also open to any feedback or suggestions you may have. Feel free to reach out to me on my social media links if you have any questions or just want to chat.
